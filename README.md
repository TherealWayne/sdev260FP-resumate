ResuMate Mobile Resume is an iOS app that allows a user to carry and edit their
resume in their pocket.  Users can enter their contact information, job history,
education and skills.  These will be displayed together in the completed resume
on the Home page of the application and can be shown to colleagues and interested
employers with just a tap.  Additionally, ResuMate has a cover letter feature
that can be used to compose, customize and display your cover letter, tailored
for the individual employer you are applying to.

When you open the ResuMate app you are presented with a splash screen with a
button which will give you access to the main app.  The Home screen is the main
area of the app, and the first thing you see dismissing the splash screen. The 
Home screen is divided into four tabs:

Home: Resume Display
Edit: Editing your resume information
Share: Sharing your resume
Cover: A tab for displaying and editing customized cover letters
