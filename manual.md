        Wayne's github account served as the primary repo for our project but we
        will not be fully sync'd until he has had an opportunity to merge the
        changes from Mohammed and Scott.
             
ResuMate Mobile Resume is an iOS app that allows a user to carry and edit their
resume in their pocket.  Users can enter their contact information, job history,
education and skills.  These will be displayed together in the completed resume
on the Home page of the application and can be shown to colleagues and interested
employers with just a tap.  Additionally, ResuMate has a cover letter feature
that can be used to compose, customize and display your cover letter, tailored
for the individual employer you are applying to.

(Wayne, Splash Screen)
When you open the ResuMate app you are presented with a splash screen with a
button which will give you access to the main app.  The Home screen is the main
area of the app, and the first thing you see dismissing the splash screen. The 
Home screen is divided into four tabs: (Some features not yet implemented)

Home: Resume Display
Edit: Editing your resume information
Share: Sharing your resume
Cover: A tab for displaying and editing customized cover letters

(Wayne and Scott)
Home: This tab displays your most recent resume or an example resume if you
havent yet entered the data for your personalized resume.

(Wayne)
Edit: Edit takes you to a screen that allows you to edit individual fields for 
your personal resume.  After submitting the personalized data your completed 
resume will be displayed on the Home tab.  

(Scott)
Share: The Share tab allows you to share your resume to your favorite Social
media sites as well as email.  You can also let your imagination run wild and 
use the Send To: button to send your resume to any company you enter in the 
text field.  No need to worry though, this is a fun feature that doesnt actually
do anything other than print to the console.

(Mohammed)
Cover: Display and Edit a cover letter tailored to each employer you wish in the 
Cover tab.  If you have not yet formulated your cover letter some example text
is provided for you.
